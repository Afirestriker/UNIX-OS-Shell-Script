
NOTE: When declaring or reading value for a variable $ sign is not needed
But when you are accessing a variable $ sign in needed

$REPLY variable is a default system variable which will store value.

unset: unset is like deleting a variable and 
       if again this same variable name is define it will define new variable with new location

readonly: readonly make variable constant, 
          and if we are declaring  variable as contant then at that time only it need to be assign a value.

NOTE: When assigning a value to variable, no whitespace should be there in between
	Wrong Example: VARIABLE_NAME = "VAR_VALUE"; 
	Right Example: VARIABLE_NAME="VAR_VALUE";   //no any space in between operator

Types of Variable:
Variable is nothing but a pointer or location in the memory where given value is stored.
